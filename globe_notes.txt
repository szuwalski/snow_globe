both sgl and nfl fisheries happen april-June
 GSL survey are summer (July-Sept)
 NFL are spring (4-6) and fall (9-12)
ebs fishery happens jan-feb; survey july-august

this could be one of the reasons the prob term molt is different??

pulled the wrong models--need the ones with skipmolting in there as it seems to be a big problem over there (figure out why we're different!)

Revisit popdy models
  include skipmolting for EBS?
clean data file creation scripts so models can be easily updated
Do probability of terminal molt GAMs for both next.
make plots of catches.
shape up the map figure (should there be one big figure with map, catch, abundances?)
get data files read
